error[E0597]: `conn` does not live long enough

     |           |
     |           borrowed value does not live long enough
     |           a temporary with access to the borrow is created here ...

     | -
     | |
     | `conn` dropped here while still borrowed
     | ... and the borrow might be used here, when that temporary is dropped and runs the destructor for type `Result<Statement<'_>, rusqlite::Error>`
     |
     = note: the temporary is part of an expression at the end of a block;
             consider forcing this temporary to be dropped sooner, before the block's local variables are dropped
help: for example, you could save the expression's value in a new local variable `x` and then make `x` be the expression at the end of the block
